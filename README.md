# 2.Purpose of the software includes:
 ### 2.1 Type of software development process
    Agile development process

 ### 2.2 Reasons for choosing this type
   - First of all, Agile development is very suitable for small software development, and our team is a small team of 4 people, using Agile development allows close cooperation and communication between members.

   - Secondly, we make customized weather forecast software for our clients. This is a customized system development within the organization, where users can participate in the development process and provide feedback in real time.

   - Thirdly,planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements.

 ### 2.3 Possible usage of the software
This software is positioned as high-end customized software and its target market is primarily the following:
- **Outdoor Enthusiasts:** Hikers, campers, mountaineers and other outdoor enthusiasts may use weather forecasting software to get detailed weather information. They may be very concerned about the accuracy and reliability of the weather.

- **Aviation and shipping industries:** The aviation and shipping industries have a significant safety and operational impact on weather conditions. Weather forecasting software can provide industries such as airlines, shipping companies and port managers with accurate weather forecasts to make decisions about flights, voyages and port operations

- **Meteorological professionals:** Meteorological professionals and researchers may use weather forecasting software to analyze weather data, produce forecast models and conduct meteorological research. They need highly accurate and detailed weather data to support their work.

# 3.Software development plan
 ### 3.1 Development Process
1.Product Planning Phase:
- Conduct meetings with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations, with a focus on outdoor enthusiasts and weather professionals.
- Define the software's vision and goals, and establish the prioritized list of product features.

2.Sprint:
- Perform requirements analysis and break down the requirements into user stories.
- Determine the iteration cycle for the current sprint, for example, 2 weeks.
- Team members undertake software design and architectural planning based on the user stories.
- Developers start coding and perform unit testing, employing continuous integration and automated testing practices.

3.Daily Stand-up Meetings:
- Team members hold brief daily meetings to share progress, discuss any challenges or issues, and plan their tasks.
- Ensure collaborative communication among team members and prompt issue resolution.

4.Incremental Delivery:
- At the end of the first sprint, the team delivers a working software increment with basic weather querying and display functionality.
- Conduct user acceptance testing to gather user feedback.

5.Iterative Development:
- Based on user feedback and evolving requirements, plan and analyze the next sprint's goals and user stories.
- Team members iterate through the development, testing, and delivery of increments for each sprint.

6.Continuous Iteration and Optimization:
- Continuously iterate through development, testing, and delivery of increments based on user feedback and changing requirements.
- Emphasize improvements in software functionality and user experience, with a focus on meeting the needs of outdoor enthusiasts and weather professionals.
